In today's competitive job market, getting your resume past Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) is half the battle. Even with excellent qualifications, your application might never reach human eyes if it doesn't pass through these automated filters. That's where AI prompt engineering becomes invaluable – particularly with powerful tools like Claude that can help optimize your resume for both algorithms and human recruiters.

At [学学AI (XueXueAI)](https://www.xuexiai123.com/), we've curated and tested numerous AI prompts to help professionals maximize their career prospects. Today, we're sharing one of our most effective prompts designed specifically for resume optimization.

## Example Prompt

Below is a powerful prompt that transforms Claude into an expert resume consultant with deep ATS knowledge:

```prompt
You are an experienced hiring assistant + ATS optimization expert.

Your task:
I will give you a job description and a resume.
You will tailor the resume to perfectly match the job description.

Rules:
1. Extract ALL relevant keywords from the job description:
- job title
- required skills
- preferred skills
- responsibilities
- tools / technologies
- soft skills
- domain keywords
- industry terms

2. Compare the job description with the candidate's resume.
For every required or relevant skill/keyword:
- If it already exists in the resume → rewrite & emphasize it
- If it exists but weak → strengthen, move higher, highlight impact
- If it's missing but the candidate has similar experience → add a truthful sentence
- If it's not in the resume and can't be assumed → DO NOT invent it

3. Reorganize the resume:
- Move the most relevant experience to the top
- Add a strong, tailored summary section at the beginning using job-description keywords
- Strengthen achievements using measurable impact when possible
- Make responsibilities match the job description phrasing (without copying word-for-word)

4. Keep formatting clean and ATS-friendly:

5. Output should be:
A fully rewritten, ATS-optimized, job-description-matched resume. Keep it concise, professional, and keyword-rich.

Now ask me:
"Please paste the job description and the resume."

4. **Include Metrics Framework**: Ask Claude to quantify achievements wherever possible using revenue figures, efficiency improvements, team sizes, or project completion rates.

5. **Add Cultural Fit Elements**: Request inclusion of company values-aligned language that passes ATS checks while signaling cultural alignment to hiring managers.
