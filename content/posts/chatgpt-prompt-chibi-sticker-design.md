While the prompt includes a variety of expressions, you can tailor them to better suit your needs.

### Refine Character Details
If you're creating stickers based on specific people or characters, add more detailed descriptions of their features. Include specific hair colors, eye shapes, signature accessories, or distinctive clothing items to make the characters more recognizable.

Enhance the prompt by specifying particular poses or activities that are relevant to your use case. For example, if creating stickers for a fitness brand, include poses like "working out", "stretching", or "celebrating a PR".
