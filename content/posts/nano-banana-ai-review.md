## Introduction

If you've been on social media lately, you've probably seen Nano Banana's amazing figurine renders going viral. Let's dive right in and explore what this AI can do, starting with its standout figurine generation feature.

## 1. Easily Customize Your Own Collectible Figurines

Every time you see a cool game scene, anime character online, or have your own artwork you're proud of, don't you wish you could have a physical figurine on your desk? But custom figurines are expensive and take time, as we all know...

I wondered, could AI skip all the traditional steps - modeling, production, setting up scenes, and photography - and just take a flat image to generate a perfect "figurine unboxing" product photo? Complete with packaging box and modeling process images?

### Prompt Example:

```
Create a photorealistic, highly detailed PVC character figure, meticulously crafted based on a photograph. The figure stands proudly on a sleek, round plastic base. Behind it, its collectible box features a high-quality print of the original character art. Adjacent to the box, a computer monitor displays the intricate 3D modeling process in Blender, showcasing the digital sculpting and texturing. The entire figure is rendered in a clear, translucent PVC material, giving it an ethereal, ghost-like quality. The scene is set within a professional design studio with soft, diffused indoor lighting that highlights the figure's form and transparency.
```

You can even turn this into a video using Veo3!

This isn't simply making a 2D image 3D - it creates a complete "story scene." You can see the physical model generated from the original image, complete with its base. There's also a collectible box with the original artwork printed on it and a computer showing the 3D wireframe!

This "one image creates everything" capability dramatically lowers the barrier to creating product renderings. For figurine manufacturers, independent designers, and even casual collectors, this is a game-changer.

- **Designers**: Can quickly generate product concept images for clients - "what you imagine is what you get."
- **Casual collectors**: Can "materialize" game screenshots or any virtual character to satisfy collecting desires.

I'd give this feature full marks - absolutely perfect. üíØ

## 2. AI as Your Personal "Pose Director"

One of the biggest headaches in e-commerce photography is posing models. Models don't always understand what you want, and sketching poses yourself often results in stick figures. I wondered if I could be a "puppet master," providing pose references and having AI "replicate" them exactly?

### Prompt Example:

```
Using the model from [Image] as the subject, and the pose from [Reference] as the reference, generate a new, photorealistic image. The subject must perfectly replicate the reference pose. Crucially, maintain the subject's identity, facial features, and clothing from her original photo. The background should be a clean, minimalist studio setting with soft lighting.
```

The fundamentals are very solid! As you can see, the person's face and clothing remain the same, but the pose has been perfectly transferred. Most impressively, it's not just crudely pasting one image onto another - even muscle orientation and clothing folds follow the pose. While joints can occasionally look a bit stiff upon close inspection, the results are good enough to dramatically improve photo shoot efficiency. üëç

## 3. Transform "Soul Sketches" into Realistic Photos

Like many people, I have brilliant design ideas but lack the drawing skills to execute them. I wanted to test AI's "fill-in-the-blanks" capability. Could I give it a rough "soul sketch" and have it "print" a real model?

### Prompt Example:

```
Transform the line art from [Sketch image] into a hyper-realistic photograph. Render a female model with realistic skin textures and natural hair flow. The clothing should be made of a soft, cotton-like material, matching the sketch's design. The lighting should be soft and natural, as if from a large window. The final image must look like a professional fashion magazine shot.
```

This was quite surprising. It not only turned the sketch into a photo but also added realistic skin textures, soft fabric quality, and perfect lighting. Essentially, I gave it a simple sketch, and it created not just a person, but also the clothing, lighting, and even the photographer! Designers should be thrilled by this.

## 4. Dress One Model in Your Entire Store's Inventory

E-commerce professionals know how expensive model photography can be. Every new style and color needs new photos - time-consuming and costly. I wanted to see if Nano Banana could solve this pain point for my friend. Give it one model and a bunch of clothes - could AI automatically generate "model shots"?

### Prompt Example:

```
Take the model from [Model image] and dress her in the complete outfit shown in [Clothing item image #1]. Place her in a bright, outdoor park setting during a sunny day. Ensure the clothes fit her body realistically, with natural folds and shadows. The model's face, hair, and identity must remain consistent.
```

Wow, the results are impressive. ü§Ø You can see the model's face and hairstyle remain basically unchanged - this is commercially viable. Most impressively, the clothing fits naturally with realistic folds and shadows, just like it was actually worn for the photo shoot. Upon closer inspection, there's a slight imperfection where the dress edge blends with the background in the second image, but honestly, you wouldn't notice without looking closely. This feature scores 90 out of 100. üëç

## 5. AI as Director: Fun Character Combinations in the Same Frame

Drawing a single person isn't impressive - it's multiple character interactions that show true skill. I threw in my two favorite anime characters and a challenging interaction pose to see if it would fail.

### Prompt Example:

```
Create a dynamic, anime-style action scene. Use the character with black hair from [Character Image 1] and the character with pink hair from [Character Image 2]. Position them according to the stick-figure sketch in [Pose Sketch]. The black-haired character is performing a flying kick, and the pink-haired character is blocking with a punch, creating a bright yellow energy impact. The setting is ancient stone ruins at dusk, with fire and embers in the background. High detail, cinematic lighting.
```

Better than I expected. Both characters were correctly identified, and the poses were basically reproduced without creating a "frankenstein" effect. Where the characters make contact, it's a bit blurry and not entirely clear. It seems AI still has room to improve in understanding "force" and "physical contact," but at this level, it outperforms 99% of amateur artists.

## 6. Scene Annotation: Owning "AR Glasses" for a Second

A moment that travel bloggers and tech reviewers will love. Can I throw in any street scene and have AI automatically identify landmarks and add AR information boxes like in sci-fi movies?

### Prompt Example:

```
Analyze the provided [Scene Image]. Identify the 1-3 most prominent landmarks, buildings, or points of interest. For each identified point, draw a neat, glowing blue outline around its silhouette. Next to each outline, overlay a clean, semi-transparent dark UI box. Inside each box, display plausible information such as a generated Name, Type/Location, and a brief, one-sentence description. The overall style should be modern and informative, like an augmented reality (AR) view.
```

This feature is incredibly cool. It truly "understands" what the main subjects are in a photo and adds frames and text accordingly. While the text is "guessed," it definitely creates that tech-savvy feel. It's a perfect tool for presentations or video thumbnails.

## 7. Give Your Logo a "Celebrity Makeover"

How can you create variations of an established brand logo? I threw in Duolingo's owl logo and asked AI to brainstorm different style variations.

### Prompt Example:

```
Using the Duolingo owl logo from [Logo Image] as the core subject, redesign it in 5 different styles: 1. Cyberpunk, with neon glows and metallic textures. 2. Steampunk, with gears, brass, and clockwork elements. 3. Minimalist line art. 4. 3D inflatable plastic toy. 5. Traditional Japanese ink wash painting (Sumi-e). Maintain the basic shape and recognizability of the owl.
```

AI's creativity really rivals human designers. Cyberpunk, steampunk, sumi-e... it handles all styles well while maintaining the logo's core recognition. In the future, designers can have AI generate 20 proposals for clients to choose from - quantity with quality. üòÇ

## 8. Voice-Controlled Photo Editing: The Real Magic

Everyone says AI photo editing is powerful, but how "intelligent" is it really? Instead of editing myself, I just used voice commands to change hair color and add glasses to see if it would understand.

### Prompt Example:

```
Take the person in [Photo of a person]. Please make two subtle changes. First, change her hair color to a light pink. Second, add a pair of modern, black-rimmed glasses to her face. Ensure the changes look natural, with correct lighting, shadows, and reflections. Do not alter her facial features or expression.
```

This is the real "magic." The hair color change looks natural with properÂÖâÊ≥Ω consideration. The glasses were added with subtle shadows. Most importantly, it only changed what I wanted without distorting the face. Photo editing apps might need to worry now.

## 9. Half Real, Half Anime: Dimensional Slash

Can an image have two artistic styles? Half real, half anime, with irregular division. This really tests AI's control over imagery.

### Prompt Example:

```
Take the image of the woman in [Input Photo]. Apply a creative split-style effect. Keep the lower half of her body (legs and boots) as the original photograph. Transform the upper half of her body (torso, arms, head) into a vibrant, 2D anime style with bold outlines and flat colors, similar to the anime 'Cyberpunk: Edgerunners'. The transition between the two styles should be a clean, slightly curved line.
```

The effect is stunning! It truly understands "irregular division" and "clean boundaries." This collision between reality and anime creates maximum artistic appeal and visual impact. Perfect for posters or social media avatars - guaranteed to turn heads.

## 10. AI as Your "Whole-House Interior Designer"

Decorating or renting is most challenging when facing an empty room, unable to imagine how furniture will look. Rendering software is expensive and hard to learn, and hiring a designer costs a fortune.

I wanted to see if AI could become an "affordable designer" for ordinary people. I gave it a photo of an empty house and "commanded" it with my voice to decorate - could it surprise me?

### Prompt Example:

```
This is a photo of an empty living room [Empty Room Photo]. Redesign it in a cozy Scandinavian style. Add a light grey fabric sofa, a natural oak wood coffee table, several green potted plants, and a large, soft wool rug. The lighting should be bright and airy, coming from the window.
```

Look at how AI perfectly understood the room's perspective, lighting, and spatial sense, then seamlessly "placed" the furniture described in my text. Most impressively, it even calculated the shadows of furniture on the floor and rug perfectly, maximizing realism.

For personal home decoration, this is a game-changer. You can "preview" your future home before buying furniture, testing Scandinavian, wabi-sabi, or industrial styles until satisfied, perfectly avoiding costly mistakes. For designers, it's also a powerful tool for quickly creating concept images for clients, greatly improving communication efficiency.

## Summary

These were our "extreme tests" of Nano Banana.

As usual, here's my personal assessment:

### Pros üëç:

**Outstanding "Face Locking" Capability**: For scenarios requiring character consistency like outfit changes or pose adjustments, it outperforms most models on the market - this is key to productivity.

**Strong Comprehension**: It understands prompts well, especially those with clear instructions like product disassembly or UI generation. It performs like a well-trained designer.

### Cons/Issues üòÇ:

**Multi-Person Scenes Still Challenging**: For complex compositions with 3+ people, it still gets confused, often creating "abstract" works with character fusion or pose confusion.

**Occasionally Too "Reserved"**: Its overall output style tends toward realistic and reserved, lacking Midjourney's more creative "artistic flair."

Overall, if Midjourney is an artist, Nano Banana is more like a top-tier commercial designer. It might not give you the biggest surprise, but it consistently delivers commercially viable results.

For those of us looking to integrate AI into our workflows, this might be the best news.
