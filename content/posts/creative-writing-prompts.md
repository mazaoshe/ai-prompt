## Introduction

AI can be an excellent collaborator for creative writing projects. Whether you're working on fiction, poetry, screenplays, or other creative endeavors, well-crafted prompts can help spark ideas, develop characters, and overcome writer's block.

## Fiction Writing

### Story Generation
```
Create an original short story (800-1000 words) with these elements:
- Genre: Science fiction mystery
- Setting: A space station orbiting a dying star
- Main character: A xenobotanist studying alien plant life
- Conflict: The alien plants are disappearing, and with them, the station's oxygen supply
- Twist: The plants aren't disappearing—they're evolving into a form invisible to humans

Include vivid descriptions, dialogue that reveals character, and build to a satisfying resolution that incorporates the twist.
```

### Character Development
```
Develop a detailed character profile for a fantasy protagonist with these requirements:
- Age: Teenager (15-18)
- Background: Orphan raised by a guild of artisans
- Special ability: Can see and communicate with the emotional auras of others
- Major flaw: Overwhelmed by strong emotions, leading to poor decision-making
- Goal: Find their birth family
- Obstacle: Their ability is considered dangerous by the ruling council

Include:
1. Physical description
2. Personality traits (strengths and weaknesses)
3. Backstory summary
4. Motivations and fears
5. Relationships with other characters
6. Character arc potential
```

### Worldbuilding
```
Design a detailed fantasy world where:
- Magic is powered by music
- Different genres of music produce different types of magic
- Only those with perfect pitch can become powerful mages
- The ruling class consists of opera singers who control weather
- There's a rebellion of punk rockers who specialize in destruction magic

Describe:
1. The geography and major cities
2. The social hierarchy
3. How magic works in detail
4. The conflict between opera mages and punk rebels
5. Daily life for ordinary citizens
6. Potential for adventure and conflict
```

## Poetry and Literary Forms

### Poetry Prompts
```
Write an original poem about the experience of learning to use AI tools for creative work. The poem should:
- Be written in free verse
- Include metaphors comparing AI collaboration to musical improvisation
- Explore themes of creativity, technology, and human expression
- Be between 12-20 lines
- Include at least one internal rhyme

Focus on the emotional journey of adapting to new creative technologies.
```

### Experimental Forms
```
Create a piece of experimental literature that tells a story through:
- Found text (emails, text messages, social media posts)
- At least 3 different character voices
- A mystery that unfolds progressively
- No traditional narrative structure

The story should be about a missing person investigation conducted through digital communications. Ensure each character's voice is distinct and the mystery builds to a satisfying conclusion.
```

## Screenwriting and Dialogue

### Script Writing
```
Write a 2-3 page scene from a dramedy screenplay with these specifications:
- Characters: A retired astronaut and their teenage grandchild
- Setting: A cluttered garage being cleaned out
- Central conflict: The grandchild wants to throw away the astronaut's memorabilia, while the astronaut is reluctant to part with it
- Subtext: The grandchild is trying to help the astronaut move to assisted living, but the astronaut sees this as giving up
- Key elements: Emotional dialogue, meaningful props, character development

Include stage directions and focus on dialogue that reveals character and advances the emotional arc.
```

### Dialogue Practice
```
Write a conversation between two characters who are:
- Former partners in a detective agency
- Meeting for the first time in 5 years
- One is investigating the death of their old mentor
- The other has information that could solve the case
- There's unresolved tension between them from their partnership's end

The conversation should take place in a coffee shop and last approximately 10 minutes of screen time. Each character should have distinct speech patterns and reveal information gradually.
```

## Overcoming Creative Blocks

### Idea Generation
```
I'm experiencing writer's block and need fresh ideas for a mystery novel. Generate 10 unique mystery plot premises that combine:
- An unusual setting (not a typical city or town)
- An unconventional detective (not a police officer or private investigator)
- A distinctive type of crime or mystery
- A compelling personal stake for the detective

Make each premise specific enough to inspire a full novel but general enough to allow for creative development.
```

### Plot Development
```
I have a basic premise: "A translator discovers that a newly discovered ancient text contains a coded message that predicts future events." Help me develop this into a full plot outline that:
- Has a clear three-act structure
- Includes 5-7 major plot points
- Introduces compelling obstacles and conflicts
- Builds to a satisfying climax and resolution
- Explores themes of knowledge, power, and responsibility

Also suggest character arcs for the protagonist and 2-3 key supporting characters.
```

## Genre-Specific Prompts

### Horror Writing
```
Write a short horror story (500-700 words) that creates fear through:
- Psychological unease rather than gore
- An unreliable narrator
- Everyday settings made sinister
- A slow build-up of tension
- An ambiguous but chilling ending

The story should center around someone who begins to suspect that their reflection in mirrors is not exactly the same as themselves, and the differences are becoming more pronounced.
```

### Romance
```
Create a meet-cute scene between two characters who:
- Have opposing professional goals (e.g., one is trying to save a building while the other is trying to demolish it)
- Are both passionate about their causes
- Have an immediate spark of attraction despite their conflict
- Show wit and intelligence in their dialogue
- Establish the central romantic tension

Set the scene at a public hearing about the building's fate. Focus on dialogue and subtle physical details that show attraction amid conflict.
```

### Historical Fiction
```
Write a 600-word historical fiction piece set during the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, from the perspective of:
- A Chinese immigrant who runs a small restaurant
- Who must decide whether to save their life's savings or help a neighbor's family escape
- Set during the first 24 hours of the disaster
- Include period-appropriate details and language
- Show both the horror of the disaster and human resilience

Focus on sensory details and internal conflict to create an immersive historical experience.
```

## Best Practices for Creative Writing Prompts

### Balance Guidance with Freedom
Good creative prompts provide enough structure to focus the AI's output while leaving room for creativity:
```
Instead of: "Write a story about a dragon"
Use: "Write a 500-word story about a dragon who works as a librarian in a magical university, where the central conflict involves a student who has checked out the same book for 50 years"
```

### Specify Format and Length
```
Instead of: "Write a poem"
Use: "Write a sonnet about the changing seasons, with each quatrain focusing on a different season, and include at least one literary allusion"
```

### Request Revision-Friendly Output
```
Instead of: "Write a character description"
Use: "Create a character profile for a detective that includes physical description, personality traits, background, and motivation. Organize this as a bullet list so it can be easily modified later"
```

## Conclusion
