## Introduction

AI models can be incredibly helpful for coding tasks when you know how to ask the right questions. Whether you need help writing new code, debugging existing code, or understanding complex concepts, well-crafted prompts can save you time and improve your skills.

## Code Generation

### Basic Code Writing
```
Act as a senior Python developer. Write a function that takes a list of dictionaries representing employees (with keys: name, department, salary) and returns the average salary for each department. Include error handling for missing keys and non-numeric salary values.
```

### Framework-Specific Tasks
```
Create a React component that displays a user profile card with the following features:
- Accepts user data as props (name, email, avatar URL, join date)
- Displays user information in a clean card layout
- Includes a button to send a message to the user
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Proper TypeScript interfaces

Use functional components and hooks where appropriate.
```

## Debugging and Troubleshooting

### Error Analysis
```
Explain what this Python error means and how to fix it:
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable

This error occurs on the line:
user_name = user_data['name']

Show common causes of this error and provide solutions for each scenario.
```

### Code Review
```
Review the following JavaScript code for potential issues:
```javascript
function calculateTotal(items) {
  let total = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i <= items.length; i++) {
    total += items[i].price;
  }
  return total;
}
```

Identify bugs, suggest improvements, and provide corrected code. Explain your reasoning for each change.
```

## Learning and Explanation

### Concept Explanation
```
Explain the concept of closures in JavaScript as if I'm a beginner programmer. Include:
1. Simple definition
2. Practical example
3. Common use cases
4. Potential pitfalls
5. How they differ from similar concepts in other languages
```

### Code Translation
```
Convert this Python code to JavaScript and explain the key differences between the two implementations:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Generate first 10 numbers
for i in range(10):
    print(fibonacci(i))
```
```

## Algorithm and Problem Solving

### Algorithm Design
```
Design an algorithm to find the longest common prefix among an array of strings. Provide:
1. Step-by-step approach
2. Pseudocode
3. Implementation in Python
4. Time and space complexity analysis
5. Test cases
```

### Data Structure Selection
```
I need to implement a system that tracks user sessions for a web application. Each session has:
- User ID
- Login time
- Last activity time
- Session data (JSON)

Sessions need to be:
- Looked up quickly by user ID
- Cleaned up when expired (last activity > 30 minutes ago)
- Updated frequently with new activity times

Recommend the most appropriate data structure(s) and explain why. Provide a basic implementation outline.
```

## Best Practices for Coding Prompts

### Be Specific About Requirements
Instead of "Write a sorting function," use:
```
Implement the quicksort algorithm in Java with the following specifications:
- Function signature: public static void quicksort(int[] arr, int low, int high)
- Use in-place sorting
- Include comments explaining the partitioning process
- Handle edge cases (empty array, single element, already sorted)
```

### Provide Context
Include relevant information such as:
- Programming language
- Framework or library being used
- Version constraints
- Performance requirements
- Expected inputs and outputs

### Request Specific Formats
```
Explain how REST APIs work. Structure your response as:
1. Definition (1 sentence)
2. Key principles (bullet points)
3. HTTP methods and their purposes (table)
4. Example request/response cycle (code examples)
5. Best practices (numbered list)
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Code Optimization
```
Optimize this Python function for better performance:
```python
def find_duplicates(arr):
    duplicates = []
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):
            if arr[i] == arr[j] && arr[i] not in duplicates:
                duplicates.append(arr[i])
    return duplicates
```

Provide multiple optimization approaches and explain the trade-offs between them.
```

### Testing Strategies
```
Create comprehensive unit tests for this JavaScript function:
```javascript
function isValidEmail(email) {
  const re = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  return re.test(email);
}
```

Include tests for:
- Valid email formats
- Invalid email formats
- Edge cases
- Boundary conditions

Use Jest framework syntax.
```

## Conclusion

Using AI for coding assistance can dramatically improve your productivity and learning. The key is crafting prompts that provide enough context and constraints to get exactly what you need. Practice with these examples and adapt them to your specific use cases. Remember to always verify AI-generated code before using it in production environments.
